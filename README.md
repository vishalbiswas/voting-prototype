# Taluka Voting

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a small-scale voting application that
allows users to cast votes for candidates in a Taluka (a small administrative division). The
application should include features such as a voting leaderboard displaying the count of votes
given to candidates, a form for users to exercise their vote, and functionalities for updating the
leaderboard dynamically. Additionally, users should be able to view a breakdown of the
demographics (gender and age) of voters when clicking on the count against a candidate.

## Requirements

### Voting Leaderboard

The application should display a leaderboard showing the count of votes given to each
candidate running for a position in the Taluka.

The leaderboard should update dynamically as new votes are cast.

### Vote Submission Form

Users should be presented with a form to cast their votes.
The form should include:

- A list of candidates to choose from.
- Options for selecting the voter's gender and age.
- A unique identifier (ID) for the voter.

Upon submission of the form, the vote count for the selected candidate should increase, and the
leaderboard should update accordingly.

### Demographic Breakdown

When a user clicks on the count of votes against a candidate, the application should provide a
breakdown of the voters based on gender and age.

The breakdown should be displayed in a clear and understandable format.

### Technology Stack

The frontend and backend of the application should be implemented using the technology stack
of the developer's choice.

The chosen stack should be suitable for developing a responsive and dynamic web application.
